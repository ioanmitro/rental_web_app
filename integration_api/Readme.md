Implementation of API key authentication:
1. The apartment listing API provider issues an API key to each developer or application that wants
   to access the API
2. The developer or application includes the API key as a parameter in each request, typically as a
   query parameter or a header.
3. The apartment listing API server verifies the API key and either approves or denies the API request 
   based on whether the API key is valid and authorized to access the requested resource.
