First, you'll need to install Node.js and NPM (Node Package Manager) if you haven't already. You can download them from the official Node.js website: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Once you have Node.js and NPM installed, create a new directory for your project and navigate to it in your terminal.

Run the following command to create a new package.json file for your project:

- npm init

Install Express.js and other necessary dependencies by running the following command
- npm install express body-parser cors --save

start the Express.js server by running node index.js that will start the server and can then make API requests to the defined endpoints
