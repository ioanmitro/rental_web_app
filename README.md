1. The user inputs location or lets the application access their location.
2. The application randomly selects an apartment listing within the user's desired distance radius.
3. The application displays the apartment's name, address, unit type, amenities, lease terms, price range, ratings, and reviews from different websites like Yelp, Google, or Apartments.com.
4. The user can filter the apartment listings by unit type, price range, rating, or distance.
5. The user can save their favorite apartment listings for future reference and share them on social media.

To implement this application, a combination of different technologies and APIs were used as follows:

1. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend user interface and interaction.
2. A backend server using a framework like Node.js and Express.js to handle API requests and responses.
3. An API like Apartments.com, Zillow, or Rent.com to search for nearby apartment listings and retrieve their information.
4. A MongoDB database to store user's favorite apartment listings.
